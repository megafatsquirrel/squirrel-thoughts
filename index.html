    <h1>I tried using HEXO</h1>
    <p>I was trying to deploy Hexo, but Github pages didn't find the index.html. I'm not sure what is happening so I change the 
        output to the root so I will have a index.html there. Still nothing on github pages. I try running `hexo clean`...it ran a rmdir at the 
        root of my project...
        Moving on to Jekyll!

        I think project templates can be great, but most of my time is modifing code already in place. I rarely get to start from scratch. Not enough docs on how to mod an existing project.
